In order to avoid failure for PDP Drools we give permit for guard decision policies only under indeterminate case. \nThis will be removed in future once we have the Guard policies policy set implementation is done.",

      "message": "It seems to me that this is a reasonable approach for the time being, failure on DB (or other external components), although unusual, happens and should have a recovery treatment, regardless production or non-production environments.   \n\nThe question is what\u0027s the best default recovery treatment for this anomaly, PERMIT, DENY, or doing nothing (letting the query to PDP-X GUARD queries timeout on the querying system, in this case, PDP-D).  PERMIT or DENY are friendly.\n\nIn any case, the default value can be tweaked on the PDP-X if the default is not suitable in an installation by an operator.   \n\nAt this point in time for Control Loops integration testing with other ONAP compoments, ie. APPC, AAI, DCAE .. I think it is the most suitable value for now.",
