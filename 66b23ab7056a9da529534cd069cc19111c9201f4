      "message": "Jorge, the only catch here is that if we already have bigger queries (except stored procedures as they are not affected) which may take more than 30 seconds to execute in loaded environments then those would get aborted and result in operation errors. \nWith this change we will get to know them and then optimize them if possible. What do you say?",
