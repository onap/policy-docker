Perhaps those should be used here, too, for consistency",

      "message": "I was trying to use wait_topic.sh. But realized that it uses \"https://${SIM_IP}:3905/events/${topic}/script/1?limit\u003d1\". limit is 1, I think drools is using it extensively.\nIt seems using that script makes it more tedious instead of making it simpler in this case, because I will have to call it 3 times for the expected  message in this case(I am expecting 3 different events on DMaaP). If I update the limit from 1 to 3, it may need more work on drools csit I guess.\nCalling the script 3 times seems less efficient to me, but I am okay to do it to keep it consisent. Comments?\n\nWill work on the other comments.",
